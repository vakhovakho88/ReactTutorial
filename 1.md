### Import Component and React, we need React to render anything

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
```
### Import  CSS file, it would act like external styling
```js
import './App.css'; 
```

### Import our created component : Person
```js
import Person from './Person';
```

## First react (class)-component
#### component self:
```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class SimpleApp extends Component
{
    render(){
        return "I am a simple class component";
    }
}

export default SimpleApp;
```
* Since we are making a default export. We can import it with another name too. 

#### import component in index.js
```js
import SimpleApp from './apps/App1';

ReactDOM.render(<SimpleApp />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
* In render function we are saying `what to render` and `where to render`
* SimpleApp could be named differently. Cause it is a default export
* In render Object we could write HTML too, but it doesnot make sence
* The main idea of React is that, we build an Application with components.
* Every Import-Name of component must begin with uppercase


## Functional Components
* Functions ar cammelcased
* ES6 syntax is strongly recommended
* Component is a function that returns JavascriptXML (JSX)
* javascript in jsx must be written in `{}`

## JSX vs React.createElement
#### JSX
```js
 return (
     <div className="App">
       I am Text in Div
       <h1>I am Text</h1>
     </div> );
```
#### React.createElement
```js
return(
      React.createElement('div', { className: 'App', id:'SomeId'},'I am Text in Div', 
          React.createElement('h1',null,'I am text')
      ))
```



## Simple functional component
#### the function under is static and has no options to change something inside
```js
import React from 'react';

const personWithoutDynamicContent = ()=> {
    return <p>Hello I am a functional component without any dynamic content</p>;
}

export default personWithoutDynamicContent;

```
#### Now lets makea function with some dynamic content

```js
import React from 'react';

const personWithDynamicContent = () => {
    return <p>Hello i am Person and I am  {Math.floor((Math.random()*30))} years old</p>
}

export default personWithDynamicContent;
```
* As we mentioned already, Javascript in JSX must be written in `{}`

#### now lets seee how can we import this component in another component

```js
import Person from './../components/functional/person1'; 

// ..........Some Stuff here 

class SimpleApp2 extends Component
{
    render()
    {
        return (<Person />);
    }
}
export default SimpleApp2;

```
* Render must have return statement
* If return statement is single-lined we don't need any parantheses
* If it is multy-lined we musst use parantheses
* Return statement may only have one root element. With nested or not nested elements.


#### Call Person-Component several Time. It returns random ages.
```js
 render()
    {
        return (
            <div>
                <Person />
                <Person />
                <Person />
            </div>
            );
    }
```

#### Functional component with `props`
* Now let us make components with parameters.
* We give them parameters dynamically.
* This parameteres are named: `props`
* When using ClassComponents we use `this.props`

```js
export const PersonWithProps = (props) => {
    return <p> hello i am {props.name} and i am {props.age} old</p>;
}
```
* export is just another way to export a function. But when we import it, the exact name musst be used.

#### Import and call a component with props

```js
// something here ....
import {PersonWithProps} from './../components/functional/person1';


class SimpleApp3 extends Component
{
    render()
    {
        return (
            <div>
                <PersonWithProps name = "John" age="30" />
                <PersonWithProps name = "Jack" age="15"/>
                <PersonWithProps name = "Max" age="50"/>
            </div>
            );
    }
}
```
* As we see it, if export is not default it must be imported with an exact name.

#### Components with props and contents

* Let us make a component that has `props` and ´content´ between tags too

```js
export const PersonWithContent = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h3>{props.children}</h3>
            <p> hello i am {props.name} and i am {props.age}  years old</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```
* `props.children` returns content between tags
* And this could be anything in html
* if we dont write anything, then it returns an empty tag

#### Using it after import
```js
 return (
            <div>
                <PersonWithContent name = "John" age="30">Info about me</PersonWithContent>
                <PersonWithContent name = "Jack" age="15">Info about me</PersonWithContent>
                <PersonWithContent name = "Max" age="50">Info about me</PersonWithContent>
            </div>
        );
```


# States
* Class that extends Component cannot have normal members and variables
* Let us make special properties called: `state`
* `Props` are passed from outside but `states` are managed inside the component
* `USE STATE WITH CARE!!!!` we must try to have it not at many places
* State cann't be changed normally, but if it changes it will lead React to change DOM too

#### Let us look at class component with state :

```js

class SimpleApp5 extends Component
{
    state = 
    {
        persons: [
            {name:"Name1", age:30},
            {name:"Name2", age:50},
            {name:"Name3", age:35}
        ],
        otherState: 'Some other value'
    }

    render(){
        return (
            <div>
                <PersonWithProps name={this.state.persons[0].name} age={this.state.persons[0].age}/>
                <PersonWithProps name={this.state.persons[1].name} age={this.state.persons[1].age}/>
                <PersonWithProps name={this.state.persons[2].name} age={this.state.persons[2].age}/>
            </div>
        );
    }

}

```
* It is not necessary to name it as state. It could have another name too.
* We can have as many states as we want
* This keyword refers to the class


## How to change a state?

* State is immutable
* That means u can't do this: `this.state.persons[0].name = "anothe name";`
* It doesn't work
* Instead, we must should take a standard method from `Component class` with name `setState`
* `this.setState(<changed state>)`
*  We will call `setState` from eventhandler

#### Our State at the beginning
```js
state = {
        persons:[
            {name: "John", age:25},
            {name: "Jack", age:30},
            {name: "Jill", age:45}
        ],
        anotherState: "Test state"
    }
```

#### Eventhandler that we created (without parameters)
```js
changeNameHandler = ()=> {   
        this.setState( {persons:[
            {name: "Leo", age:25},
            {name: "Jack", age:30},
            {name: "Jill", age:45}
        ]});
    }
```
* as we see it updates only the name of first element

#### Call it after button click
```js
 render(){
        return (
            <div>
                <PersonWithProps name={this.state.persons[0].name} age={this.state.persons[0].age}/>
                <button onClick={this.changeNameHandler}> change name </button>
            </div>
        )
    }
```
* If we would write `this.changeNameHandler()`, then it would be called imediately during rendering (we don't want it)
* It will change the name of first person element
* It will change it in DOM too. (UI will be updated automatically)
* Only `persons` will be updated. It wouldn not touch another elements of state
* But `persons` will be replaced fully. it means:
```js
changeNameHandler = ()=> {   
        this.setState( {persons:[
            {name: "Leo", age:25}
        ]});
    }
``` 
* In this case another two elements of persons will be deleted.
* but only persons....

* `this.setState` is only availlable in Class-based component
* It only updates persons State and not another states inside it.
* If we shoult take one element out, it would be deleted, and DOM says it doesnt find it (ERROR)
* There are 2 ways to update the DOM, `changing States` and `Props`

### Now lets see, how do we call an eventhandler with parameters.
#### Eventhandler:
```js
  changeMemberHandler=(newMemberName)=>
    {
        this.setState({
            member1: newMemberName,
            member2: 'I am member2'
        })
    }
```
* member1 will be the value of `newMemberName` argument

#### Call the eventhandler
```js
     <button onClick={this.changeMemberHandler.bind(this,"my new name")}>change member1</button>
```
#### Or as anonymous function
```js
    <button onClick={()=>this.changeMemberHandler("new name")}>change member1</button>
```
* The first way is better.


#### Now let us make an eventhandler that changes value of div when we mane input in textbox
```js
    state = {inputText:"Startwert"}

    textChangedEvent = (event)=>
    {
        this.setState(
            {inputText: event.target.value}
        );
    }

    render(){
        return(
            <div>
                <div>{this.state.inputText}</div>
                <input type='text' onChange={this.textChangedEvent} value={this.state.inputText}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
```
* `event.target.value` returns a value of event-sender

## Update state from child component
* We have a method that changes state
* We can pass this method reference to a child component that it can call it
* We can pass it with props just like a normal variable
### Lets see it in action
#### Parent component
```js
class SimpleApp9 extends Component
{
    state = {text:"I am a text"};
    
    updateTextEvent = (newText)=>{
        this.setState({text:newText});
    }

    render(){
         return (
         <ComponentForStateUpdate text={this.state.text} clickEvent = {this.updateTextEvent}/>
             );
        }
}
```
* `clickEvent = {this.updateTextEvent}` pass the method method reference. We can call it whatever we want.

#### Child component
```js
export const ComponentForStateUpdate = (props) =>{
    return (
        <div>
            <p>{props.text}</p>
            <button onClick={props.clickEvent.bind(this,"I am updated text")}>Update text</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```
* After ckliking a Button the text changes in state and it will be changed in DOM too


## Hooks
#### Hooks are like state in functional components 
* Default way to manage states is setState
* But there is another way too: Hooks 
* We can't manage states in functional components
* Thats why we need Hooks

#### First af all we should import `useState method` from react
```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
```
#### In functional component
```js
    const functionalState = useState({
        person: [
            { name:"Vakho", age:26 },
            { name:"Vakho", age:26 }
        ],
        anotherState: "Just another state"
    });
```
* useState returns array of two elements
    1. First element is a current state
    2. The second element is a function that can be used to update a state and change DOM

#### Instead of using an array-element let us use destructuring to make our job easier
```js
const { myState, myStateMethod } = useState({
        person: [
            { name:"Vakho", age:26 },
            { name:"John", age:50 }
        ],
        anotherState: "Just another state"
    });
```
#### Eventhandler in functional component
* We can have inner functions in functions
* It means we can have eventhandler as inner function
* And unlike class components we don't need ``this` keyword with method calls and method references.
* with bind we still need this.

#### Let us make an eventHandler that changes Hook.
```js
const changeNameEvent = ()=>{
        myStateMethod(
            {
                person: [
                    { name:"Changed Name", age:26 },
                    { name:"John", age:50 }
                ]
            }
        )
    }
```
* `myStateMethod` is our destructured method
* `Very important:` The biggest difference with states is that, it doesnt remove only concrete part,
it replaces everything.
* It means that `anotherState` will be deleted, and we don't want it.

#### Solution number1: Explicitely assign all members. (Inside the eventhandler)
* We are avoiding to loose anotherState with assigning it own value
```js
 myStateMethod(
            {
                person: [
                    { name:"Changed Name", age:26 },
                    { name:"John", age:50 }
                ],
                anotherState: myState.anotherState
            }
        )
```
* `anotherState: myState.anotherState`
* But it is too difficult to manage everything with big states,
* That's why it is better idea to splitt our state in little atomic states
* U can have as many state (Hook) as u want.
```js
    const firstName = useState("John");
    const age = useState(30);
    const person = useState({name:"Name1", age:50});
```
* We could also use destructuring here.
